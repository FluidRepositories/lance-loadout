## A bite-sized loadout manager for GTA V.  
Quickly save, clear, and load your loadouts from file. It could not be simpler.  
Plus, the "load loadout" list live-updates, so you don't need to restart the script to see the new loadout files. Ever.  

## Install
Drag everything except the readme.md and LICENSE.txt into your Lua Scripts folder. Done and done.
